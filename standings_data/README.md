# Standings snapshot

This directory stores the cached standings JSON (`bp_fall_2025.json`) that the site loads from the same origin to avoid cross-origin failures. The committed file is only a small sample so the UI works offline—refresh it with `./scripts/fetch-standings.sh` to pull the real data.
